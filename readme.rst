casagui Runtime JavaScript Repository
=====================================

This directory is the repository that exports minified `casaguijs <https://github.com/casangi/casagui/tree/main/casaguijs>`_ libraries for runtime usage.

At some point, we need to find a better way to publish this to a high availablity location. npm repositories do not seem like a good fit, but probably there is a better way.
